## What is it?

DataJunction (DJ) is an open source **metrics platform** that allows users to define metrics
and the data models behind them using **SQL**, serving as a **semantic layer** on top of a physical
data warehouse. By leveraging this metadata, DJ can enable efficient retrieval of metrics data
across different dimensions and filters.

## How does this work?

At its core, DJ stores metrics and their upstream abstractions as interconnected nodes.
These nodes can represent a variety of elements, such as tables in a data warehouse (source
nodes), SQL transformation logic (transform nodes), dimensions logic, metrics logic, and
even selections of metrics, dimensions, and filters (cube nodes).

By parsing each nodeâ€™s SQL into an AST and through dimensional links between columns, DJ
can infer a graph of dependencies between nodes, which allows it to find the appropriate
join paths between nodes to generate queries for metrics.
